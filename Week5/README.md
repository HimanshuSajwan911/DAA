### Week4
#### Given an unsorted arra of alphabets containing duplicate elements.Design an algorithm and implement it using a program to find which alphabet has maximum number of occurrences and print it. (Time Complexity = O(n)).

#### Given an unsorted array of integers, design an algorithm and implement it using a program to find whether two elements exist such that their sum is equal to the given key element. (Time Complexity = O(n * log(n)).

#### Given two sorted integer arrays of size m and n.Design an algorithm and implement it using a program to find list of elements which are common to both. (Time Complexity = O(m + n)).
